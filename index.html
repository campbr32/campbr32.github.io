   <h2>Biography</h2>
    <ul>
        <p> Growing up and spliting my time between Northwestern Ontario and Eastern Ontario 
            has given me a different perspective that not many other people have had. I have been 
            able to work across Ontario in different roles gaining a unique experince in the 
            work force. I have been able to learn different languages, work outside and learn to 
            appreciate the world around me, as well as in an office improving and planning existing 
            infrastucture and historical building. All these experiences have made me the hardworking 
            and eager person I am today.
